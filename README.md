LeafHacker's PvP Stuff

Simple resource pack to change a few PvP/PvE related textures.

Based on [Faithful 32](https://github.com/XVTEAM/Faithful) and [Vanilla Tweaks](https://xisumavoid.com/vanillatweaks/) as well as some custom bits.

- Steak hunger bar: Measure hunger in steak instead of drumsticks
- Low fire: Faithful fire texture, lowered a bit to increase visibility
- Low shield: Lower shield model, increased visibility (from Vanilla Tweaks)
- Transparent pumpkin: Make the pumpkin overlay more transparent (from Vanilla Tweaks)
- Wither Hearts: Make it easier to see your health while withered (based on Faithful GUI icons, inspired by Vanilla Tweaks)
